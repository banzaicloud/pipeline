// EksNodePoolVolumeInstanceStore - Configuration of instance store volumes mounted onto an EKS node pool node instance. Instance store volumes are encrypted at rest by default using an XTS-AES-256 block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance. The size and type of an instance store volume is fixed based on the instance type the volume is attached to. For more details see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#instance-store-volumes.
type EksNodePoolVolumeInstanceStore struct {

	// Type of the mounted volume's storage on the node instances of the node pool.
	Storage string `json:"storage"`
}
