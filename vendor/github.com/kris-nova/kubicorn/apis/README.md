# Cluster API

This represents a Kubernetes cluster.

### Glossary

✖ This is not a `spec`.

✖ This is not a `model`.

✔ This is an `API`.

### What it is

This is a representation of a Kubernetes cluster.
This is cloud agnostic, and is defined by `struct{}`'s in Go.

### The future

There are several stakeholders in the open source community coming together to create an official cluster API to be used with deployment tools.

Kubicorn will use this in the future.
