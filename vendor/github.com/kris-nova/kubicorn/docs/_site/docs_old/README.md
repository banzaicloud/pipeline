# Kubicorn Documentation

### Rules

###### Know what you are writing

You either are writing cloud specific docs or you aren't.
If you are writing documentation for a cloud, please treat it as such.
Cloud docs go in their directory, and talk about specific clouds.
If you are writing docs for global concepts, keep them in the top level directory, and never mention a cloud.

###### Keep tables formatted

If you are making a table in markdown: YES, we expect you to format them nicely. Keep our shit clean please.

###### Complete sentences

A complete sentence expresses a complete thought.
Always write complete sentences.
Always use proper grammar.
Each sentence goes on a new line.

###### Write inclusively

Always use "we" when referring to the project, and always refer to the user as "the user".


###### Must and Might

Use the word MUST to explain something a user has to accomplish in your documentation.
Use the word MIGHT to explain something a user optionally can chose to accomplish in your documentation.
Never use the word MAY.
