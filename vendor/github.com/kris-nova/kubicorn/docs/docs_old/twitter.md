# Twitter

We use the handle `kubicornk8s` as our official twitter handle, [check it out!](https://twitter.com/kubicornk8s)

We have automation in place to tweet out all commits from the `master` branch so please take advantage of that!

### Ways to promote on twitter via your commit message

1. You can include the official `#kubicorn` hashtag
2. Highlight yourself, and others relevant to the feature
3. Give short, powerful commit headers
