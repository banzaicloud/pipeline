Here's how the `Friends of kubicorn` section works:

1. For every entry there should be a separate file in the `/docs/_friends/` directory.
2. Every file must have a YAML header in the format below.
3. The expected content is markdown, below the header.
4. All logo files should have a *square* aspect ratio, and be saved in `/docs/img/`.

E.g.

```markdown
---
title: [Name of company/product/service]
logo: /img/[yourlogo].png
---

[Company/product/service] is our friend.

It supplies us an infinite supply of snacks and rad stickers!!

Buy their stuff!
```
