Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of
pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Use Helm to:

- Find and use [popular software packaged as Kubernetes charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts)
- Share your own applications as Kubernetes charts
- Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications
- Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files
- Manage releases of Helm packages

## Helm in a Handbasket

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.
Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.

- Helm has two parts: a client (`helm`) and a server (`tiller`)
- Tiller runs inside of your Kubernetes cluster, and manages releases (installations)
  of your charts.
- Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD, or wherever you want it to run.
- Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:
  - A description of the package (`Chart.yaml`)
  - One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files
- Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories
  (like Debian or RedHat packages)

## Install

Binary downloads of the Helm client can be found at the following links:

- [OSX](https://kubernetes-helm.storage.googleapis.com/helm-v2.9.0-rc5-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Linux](https://kubernetes-helm.storage.googleapis.com/helm-v2.9.0-rc5-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Linux 32-bit](https://kubernetes-helm.storage.googleapis.com/helm-v2.9.0-rc5-linux-386.tar.gz)
- [Windows](https://kubernetes-helm.storage.googleapis.com/helm-v2.9.0-rc5-windows-amd64.tar.gz)

Unpack the `helm` binary and add it to your PATH and you are good to go!
macOS/[homebrew](https://brew.sh/) users can also use `brew install kubernetes-helm`.

To rapidly get Helm up and running, start with the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#quickstart-guide).

See the [installation guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) for more options,
including installing pre-releases.

## Roadmap

The [Helm roadmap uses Github milestones](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/milestones) to track the progress of the project.
