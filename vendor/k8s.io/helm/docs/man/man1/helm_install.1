.SH NAME
.PP
helm\-install \- install a chart archive


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBhelm install [CHART]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command installs a chart archive.

.PP
The install argument must be a chart reference, a path to a packaged chart,
a path to an unpacked chart directory or a URL.

.PP
To override values in a chart, use either the '\-\-values' flag and pass in a file
or use the '\-\-set' flag and pass configuration from the command line.

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ helm install \-f myvalues.yaml ./redis

.fi
.RE

.PP
or

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ helm install \-\-set name=prod ./redis

.fi
.RE

.PP
You can specify the '\-\-values'/'\-f' flag multiple times. The priority will be given to the
last (right\-most) file specified. For example, if both myvalues.yaml and override.yaml
contained a key called 'Test', the value set in override.yaml would take precedence:

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ helm install \-f myvalues.yaml \-f override.yaml ./redis

.fi
.RE

.PP
You can specify the '\-\-set' flag multiple times. The priority will be given to the
last (right\-most) set specified. For example, if both 'bar' and 'newbar' values are
set for a key called 'foo', the 'newbar' value would take precedence:

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ helm install \-\-set foo=bar \-\-set foo=newbar ./redis

.fi
.RE

.PP
To check the generated manifests of a release without installing the chart,
the '\-\-debug' and '\-\-dry\-run' flags can be combined. This will still require a
round\-trip to the Tiller server.

.PP
If \-\-verify is set, the chart MUST have a provenance file, and the provenenace
fall MUST pass all verification steps.

.PP
There are four different ways you can express the chart you want to install:
.IP "  1." 5
By chart reference: helm install stable/mariadb
.IP "  2." 5
By path to a packaged chart: helm install ./nginx\-1.2.3.tgz
.IP "  3." 5
By path to an unpacked chart directory: helm install ./nginx
.IP "  4." 5
By absolute URL: helm install 
\[la]https://example.com/charts/nginx-1.2.3.tgz\[ra]

.PP
CHART REFERENCES

.PP
A chart reference is a convenient way of reference a chart in a chart repository.

.PP
When you use a chart reference ('stable/mariadb'), Helm will look in the local
configuration for a chart repository named 'stable', and will then look for a
chart in that repository whose name is 'mariadb'. It will install the latest
version of that chart unless you also supply a version number with the
'\-\-version' flag.

.PP
To see the list of chart repositories, use 'helm repo list'. To search for
charts in a repository, use 'helm search'.
