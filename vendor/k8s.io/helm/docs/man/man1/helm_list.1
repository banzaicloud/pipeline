helm\-list \- list releases


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBhelm list [flags] [FILTER]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command lists all of the releases.

.PP
By default, it lists only releases that are deployed or failed. Flags like
'\-\-deleted' and '\-\-all' will alter this behavior. Such flags can be combined:
'\-\-deleted \-\-failed'.

.PP
By default, items are sorted alphabetically. Use the '\-d' flag to sort by
release date.

.PP
If an argument is provided, it will be treated as a filter. Filters are
regular expressions (Perl compatible) that are applied to the list of releases.
Only items that match the filter will be returned.

.PP
If no results are found, 'helm list' will exit 0, but with no output (or in
the case of no '\-q' flag, only headers).

.PP
By default, up to 256 items may be returned. To limit this, use the '\-\-max' flag.
Setting '\-\-max' to 0 will not return all results. Rather, it will return the
server's default, which may be much higher than 256. Pairing the '\-\-max'
flag with the '\-\-offset' flag allows you to page through results.
