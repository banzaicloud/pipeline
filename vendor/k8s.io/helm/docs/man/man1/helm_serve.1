.SH NAME
.PP
helm\-serve \- start a local http web server


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBhelm serve\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command starts a local chart repository server that serves charts from a local directory.

.PP
The new server will provide HTTP access to a repository. By default, it will
scan all of the charts in '$HELM\_HOME/repository/local' and serve those over
the local IPv4 TCP port (default '127.0.0.1:8879').

.PP
This command is intended to be used for educational and testing purposes only.
It is best to rely on a dedicated web server or a cloud\-hosted solution like
Google Cloud Storage for production use.

.PP
