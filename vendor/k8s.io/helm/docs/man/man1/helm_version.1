.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBhelm version\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION

Tiller. The output will look something like this:

Client: \&version.Version{SemVer:"v2.0.0", GitCommit:"ff52399e51bb880526e9cd0ed8386f6433b74da1", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Server: \&version.Version{SemVer:"v2.0.0", GitCommit:"b0c113dfb9f612a9add796549da66c0d294508a3", GitTreeState:"clean"}
.IP \(bu 2
SemVer is the semantic version of the release.
.IP \(bu 2
GitCommit is the SHA for the commit that this version was built from.
.IP \(bu 2
GitTreeState is "clean" if there are no local code changes when this binary was
built, and "dirty" if the binary was built from locally modified code.

use '\-\-server'.
