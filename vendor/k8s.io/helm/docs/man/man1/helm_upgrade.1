.SH NAME
.PP
helm\-upgrade \- upgrade a release


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBhelm upgrade [RELEASE] [CHART]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command upgrades a release to a new version of a chart.

.PP
The upgrade arguments must be a release and chart. The chart
argument can be either: a chart reference('stable/mariadb'), a path to a chart directory,
a packaged chart, or a fully qualified URL. For chart references, the latest
version will be specified unless the '\-\-version' flag is set.

.PP
To override values in a chart, use either the '\-\-values' flag and pass in a file
or use the '\-\-set' flag and pass configuration from the command line.

.PP
You can specify the '\-\-values'/'\-f' flag multiple times. The priority will be given to the
last (right\-most) file specified. For example, if both myvalues.yaml and override.yaml
contained a key called 'Test', the value set in override.yaml would take precedence:

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ helm upgrade \-f myvalues.yaml \-f override.yaml redis ./redis

.fi
.RE

.PP
You can specify the '\-\-set' flag multiple times. The priority will be given to the
last (right\-most) set specified. For example, if both 'bar' and 'newbar' values are
set for a key called 'foo', the 'newbar' value would take precedence:

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ helm upgrade \-\-set foo=bar \-\-set foo=newbar redis ./redis

.fi
.RE
